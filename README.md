My Armbian configurations for my Orange Pi 5 Plus 8GB SBC.

I absolutely do not recommend using it, and even if you do, it's at your own risk bro(hacı).

Even if you wanted to, you wouldn’t be able to install it. It pulls packages from my own repository, where a system I built automatically and regularly fetches the source code from JeffyCN and rockchip-linux, then builds and packages it. Since it also packages libmali, and I have no desire to deal with copyright lawsuits, I don’t make it public.


Update: I switched GPU to panthor and published packages. Still not recommending.
